            <h1>Tropical Rainforests </h1>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>Tropical rainforests are rainforests that occur in areas of tropical rainforest climate in which there is no dry season all months have an average precipitation of at least 60 mm (2.4 in)  and may also be referred to as lowland equatorial evergreen rainforest. True rainforests are typically found between 10 degrees north and south of the equator, and are a sub-set of the tropical forest biome that occurs roughly within the 28-degree latitudes (in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Climate</b>
                
                <p>Tropical rainforests are characterized by a warm and wet climate with no substantial dry season. Mean monthly temperatures exceed 18 °C (64 °F) during all months of the year. Average annual rainfall is no less than 168 cm (66 in) and can exceed 1,000 cm (390 in) although it typically lies between 175 cm (69 in) and 200 cm (79 in).</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Vegetation</b>
                
                <p>Tropical rainforests are home to an incredibly diverse range of plant life, with over half of the world's known plant species found in these forests. The vegetation is characterized by tall, evergreen trees with broad leaves. Lianas (climbing plants) and epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants) are also common.
                </p></li>
                <li><b>Fauna</b>
                
                <p>Tropical rainforests are also home to a wide variety of animal life, including insects, birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Some of the most iconic rainforest animals include monkeys, snakes, jaguars, toucans, and parrots.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Biodiversity</b>
                
                <p>Tropical rainforests are the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. They are home to over half of the world's known species of plants and animals. This biodiversity is due to the warm and wet climate, which provides ideal conditions for life to thrive.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Importance</b>
                
                <p>Tropical rainforests play an important role in the global environment. They help to regulate the Earth's climate, provide clean water and air, and are home to a wide variety of medicinal plants. Rainforests are also important cultural and spiritual sites for many indigenous peoples.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Threats</b>
                
                <p>Tropical rainforests are facing a number of threats, including deforestation, logging, mining, and climate change. Deforestation is the clearing of rainforests for other uses, such as agriculture and development. This is a major problem because it destroys habitat and reduces biodiversity. Logging and mining also damage rainforests and contribute to deforestation. Climate change is also a threat to rainforests because it is causing more extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods.</p></li>
                
                <li><b>Conservation</b>
                
                <p>There are a number of efforts underway to conserve tropical rainforests. These efforts include protected areas, sustainable forestry practices, and education campaigns. It is important to protect tropical rainforests because they are essential to the health of the planet and the well-being of all people.</p></li>
