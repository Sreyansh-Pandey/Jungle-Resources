        <h1>Tropical Rainforests </h1>
        <!-- <img src="" alt=""> -->
        <p>Tropical rainforests are the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, home to an estimated half of all plant and animal species. These forests are found in a narrow band around the equator, and they are characterized by warm temperatures, high humidity, and abundant rainfall.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Wildlife</h2>
            
            <p>The wildlife of tropical rainforests is incredibly diverse, with species found in every imaginable niche. Some of the most iconic animals include:</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Mammals:</b><p> Jaguars, gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, monkeys, sloths, anteaters, and tapirs.</p>

            <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
            <p>Tropical rainforests are home to an estimated 3 to 50 million species of plants and animals, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. This high level of biodiversity is due to a number of factors, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Warm temperatures and high humidity: These conditions are ideal for plant and animal life.</li>
              <li>Abundant rainfall: Rainforests receive an average of 80 inches of rain per year, which supports a wide variety of plants and animals.</li>
              <li>Diverse habitats: Tropical rainforests have a variety of habitats, including rainforests, cloud forests, and mangrove forests. This provides a wide range of niches for plants and animals to occupy.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
            
            <li><h3>Importance of biodiversity</h3>
              <p>The biodiversity of tropical rainforests is important for a number of reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ecosystem services: Tropical rainforests provide a number of ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, water purification, and pollination.</li>
              <li>Medicinal resources: Tropical rainforests are a source of many important medicinal plants.</li>
